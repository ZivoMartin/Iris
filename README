# Iris

Iris is a fast, simple and lightweight database engine built in rust. Iris is not compatible with all the language yet, only c++ and of course Rust. 
Care Iris is clearly not stable !

## Installation

Iris is a personal project that i use in my own project so if you want to give it a try you need to have cargo and rustc downloaded on your machin. Then clone the entire iris source code compile it and link it to your project ! 

## Usage

You can use Iris in Rust and C++, there is no documentation yet, so if you want to understand how to use it you have to look at the source code.
